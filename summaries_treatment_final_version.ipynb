    "**Goal**: The complex-to-understand function has multiple roles. The main goal is to analyze each sentence of the summary and to retrieve any character name defined as a \"Person\" object by the NLP. It create a dataframe where each row is a sentence, with all the Lemmas of the sentence and also grammatical characteristic lemmas regrouped (verb, nouns, etc). The second goal is to create a matrix (similar to a BOW) containing each sentence by rows and each words of the sentences by columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How**: First a loop is computed on each sentence of a summary. Then, for each sentence, all the words, the grammatical structure type, the object type and the lemmas is retrieved. The \"Person\" object are found and further processed: If a person have a first and second name that are subsequent, the function record it as a single person (eg. Harry Potter), this is done by comparing the grammatical type of subsequent \"Persons\" placement in the sentence (if there is a \"Person\" at word_id=11 and word_id=12). Then the function also handle the fact that there can be multiple characters in one sentence and thus create a single string to save the characters name (Harry Potter & Hagrid). If no character is found, it simply add \"NoCharacter\" in the character column. Finally, the words of a certain gramatical type are grouped together to be saved in a single cell depending of the word type.\n",

    "**Comment**: This the messy function as it was the first created and the architecture works, but has requiered adjustement all along the script creation. It can be easily seen that the python/xml file handling was not of high performance. \n"
